##  Public Temp Email but on Discord!!
Are you tired of finding a temp mail online and it end up breaking or you want to share your spam and dangerous email to everybody on Discord or just send any email you want? Well this bot is perfect for you!

**What does this bot do?**
- This bot is just an email BUT directly to Discord! No login to the email account, just sent an email to the bot's email and you will receive it in an instant Cool right?

**But I come with limitation:**
- Luckily I have a subscription for this website so I can handle up to 10,000 emails per month. After the bot reaches this limit, you can't sent any email to me until next month.
- Due to Discord Embed Limitation, I can only display few things on the embedded message but you can still view the whole email and attachments by clicking the email link provided.
- Downside being that your email will be publicly visible from other users if you sent it from the bot's email so be sure you use this just for verification or just use a throwaway email to sent anything you like.

**What features do this idiotic and stupid but amazing bot have?**
Well, don't ask because this bot can:
- Display an email directly to your embed message.
- Modify your tag mail to prevent conflict. (Might add mail filters when enough support has given)
- Use the email as a temporary email or share/promote any email using the bot's email.
- Can hold up to 10,000 emails per month so people can use this whenever they want.
- Allow you to download the raw email file like the HTML format and attachments
and bake you a burnt cake for you (oh wait ignore that part...)

**What's coming soon?**
- Mail Tag Filtering. This so you don't have to deal with overflowing emails and unable to find your email. (This will be added if a lot of people uses this bot)
- HTML Email View. This is useful since you actually need to download the email in order to view the whole thing which is stupid and dumb idea.
- Customizable Email Address. Well I really want this to happened but I can't find an API other than the one I'm using right now.
- Extended Email Information. The API I have has WAY more info than the one I use, it has like  CC emails, Embedded Attachments and much more.
- Spam Detection. This so the bot can detect is if is a spam or not.
- Automatic New Email. If the bot received a new email, the bot will go to the linked channel and shows it there without having to do anything. Useful for just making Discord your default mail service xD.

I use [testmail.app](https://testmail.app/) to sent all the API into the bot so everybody who has this bot in their server can publicly see it.

To add this to your bot, change the Discord Bot Token at [setting.json](https://github.com/DumbCaveSpider/Arctic-Temp-Mail/blob/main/data/settings.json)

You can invite my bot at [Discord Bot List](https://discord.ly/arctic-mail). It's free to use!
