So you wondering what do I do? Well I can:**\n`-` Be uses a temp email for verification\n`-` Sent a random email to my provided email and everybody who has me in their server can view it\n`-` Just basically a public Email for everybody to use\n`-` You can change the tag of my email to make it different from others\n**But since I'm connected using [testmail.app](https://testmail.app), I come with limitation:**\n`-` Luckly I have a subscription for this website so I can handle up to 10,000 emails per month. After the bot reaches this limit, you can't sent any email to me until next month.\n`-` Due to Discord Embed Limitation, I can only display few things on the embedded message but you can still view the whole email and attachments by clicking the email link provided.\n`-` Downside being that your email will be publicly visible from other users if you sent it from the bot's email so be sure you use this just for verification or just use a throwaway email to sent anything you like.\n\nYou can change the tag between `9iyl1.` and `@inbox.testmail.app`.\nFor example: `9iyl1.test@inbox.testmail.app` or `9iyl1.anythinghere@inboxmail.app`\n\nTo start using me, do `${tempVars(\"prefix\")}help` to show all the commands.\n\nHave fun! -ArcticWoof","name":"Set Embed Description"},{"storage":"1","varName":"embed","channel":"4","varName2":"","storage3":"0","varName3":"","name":"Send Embed Message"}],"restriction":"1","permissions":"ADMINISTRATOR"}]
